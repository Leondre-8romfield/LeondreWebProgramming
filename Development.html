               <h2>My Strengths</h2>
               <p>
                   In regards to my Strengths: I am a critical and logical thinker, creative mind that explores innovation
                   and I am also person who tries to be self aware.
               </p>
               <p>
                   In my reasoning of present occurances, I try to think realistically in achieving contemporary tasks. When I think of the future
                    (whether near or distant) I explore my creativity to widen my scope. Lastly being self-aware I maintain personal integrity and
                    strive not to be immoral or unjust.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Have I been improving on my skills? No, not yet atleast; But I have been trying my best to maintain my strengths.

                <h3> Pillar 4</h3>
                <p> called "Achieving Your Goals". <br>
                "Plan, Do, Check, Adjust" is a smart way to keep <br>
                track of your progress. Setting objectives has the <br>
                added benefit of making you a better person as a result of attaining them.</p>
                                    
                <h3> Pillar 5</h3>
                <p>Don't put it off; the end of your life will arrive sooner than you think.<br>
                Remember that every day you spend is one fewer day you have to spend,<br>
                so make the most of each one. "Every day brings a plethora of chances,<br>
                but there is only one great opportunity." </p>
                                    
                <h3>Pillar 6</h3>
                <p> Every relationship you have, whether good, neutral, or bad,<br> 
                is an association. Choose your friends carefully because you will become like them.<br> 
                Surround yourself with winners, successful individuals who demonstrate <br>
                and exemplify principles and talents you want to learn and improve.</p>

                <h3>Pillar 7</h3>
                <p>After completing your formal education, you will spend the majority of your life.<br>
                Wealth, health, and spirituality all start with education.<br>
                Consider your personal experiences to see what went well and what didn't.<br>
                Read literature, look at successful individuals, and think about yourself. <br>
                You will make a fortune through self-education.</p>
